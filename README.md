# 1ClickPic

## Beautiful placeholder images in one click.

**API**: [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/)

**Live Site**: [1ClickPic](https://buddhablake.github.io/buddhablake/)

**Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery

**Additional Technologies**: Figma, Google Fonts

**Approach**: The idea for the app is to offer a quick and simple way for developers and designers to find high quality placeholder images for their sites and/or mockups. The user is exposed to only one image at a time and is limited to 10 images per query accessible via an image carousel. Images can then be copied to the user clipboard with one click in the form of a URL or as an HTML image tag. The user also has the option to view the image full-size and download it from Pexels directly. The intention is to reduce analysis paralysis and increase the speed at which a prototype/mockup is developed.

**Unsolved Problems**:

- I was not able to implement click to download functionality as most modern browsers prohibit cross origin file downloads. This could eventually be resolved by temporarily storing the image on my servers, allowing for the download, then purging the image thereafter.

- While the site is mobile responsive, it was difficult to translate the UI to mobile and maintain the desired user experience. I don’t see this being a problem as the audience this was developed for will likely be interacting with it on desktop. In the future I would likely strip down the mobile functionality to “Search & Save.” Mobile users could search for photos and save them to their account to access later on desktop when prototyping.
